Binary trees
This Project was carried out between I and my partner as part of our Full Stack Software Engineering Programme at ALX Holberton School. It aims to learn about what is a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through in a binary tree and the different types of binary trees (complete, full, perfect and balanced).
